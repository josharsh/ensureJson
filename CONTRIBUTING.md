## Development Setup

### Python (`ensure-py`)

- Requires Python 3.7+
- Recommended: use a virtual environment

```bash
cd ensureJson/ensure-py
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[schema]  # Installs pydantic for schema validation
```

- To run the CLI:
  ```bash
  echo '{ name: "Alice", age: 42, }' | python -m ensure_py.cli
  ```

- To run tests:
  ```bash
  python test/test.py
  ```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (`ensure-js`)

- Requires Node.js 18+ and npm or pnpm

```bash
cd ensureJson/ensure-js
npm install
npm run build
```

- To run the CLI:
  ```bash
  echo '{ name: "Alice", age: 42, }' | npx ensure-json
  ```

- To run tests:
  ```bash
  node test.js
  ```

## Coding Standards

- **Python:** Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Use type hints where possible.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Use modern ES2020+ syntax and TypeScript best practices.
- Linting:
  - Python: Use `flake8` or `black` if available.
  - JS/TS: Use `biome check .` (see package.json scripts).

- Write clear, concise docstrings and comments.
- Keep code dependency-free unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Testing

- Add or update tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Keep tests minimal and focused.
- For Python, place tests in `ensure-py/test/`.
- For JS/TS, use `ensure-js/test.js` or add to a `test/` directory if expanding.

---

## Proposing Changes

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) to discuss major changes before starting work.
- For small fixes, feel free to submit a PR directly.
- Reference related issues in your PR description.

---

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Example: `Fix: handle trailing commas in ensure_json.py`
- For multi-package changes, mention both: `Docs: update usage in ensure-py and ensure-js`

---
